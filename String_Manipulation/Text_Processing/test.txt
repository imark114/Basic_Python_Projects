In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include Kedelkloppersprook [de], which originated around Hamburg harbour, and Mattenenglisch that was used in the Matte, the traditional working-class neighborhood of Bern.[citation needed] Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by voluntary associations.[15] A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by i, in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ee.
